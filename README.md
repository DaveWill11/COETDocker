# README
API created using Ruby on Rails, Postgres, Redis, and Docker
I'm not sure if I ever got the Redis caching working properly, but it still performed well.

Ruby version 3.1.4

Should run smooth from a "docker-compose up", if you had the environment variables...

You will not be able to access the database without them.
